HaskMus: A Haskell Algorithmic Composition Toolkit

HaskMus is an algorithm composition toolkit and Domain-Specific Language (DSL) developed in Haskell. It is designed for the creation and manipulation of music structures, offering an approach to music composition through algorithmic methods.

Current Features (under development):

    Data.WAVE Module: Provides functionalities for working with WAVE audio files, enabling the creation, manipulation, and analysis of sound data.
    Pitch and Rhythm Modules: Includes a comprehensive set of tools for defining and manipulating musical pitches and rhythms, offering a flexible framework for algorithmic composition.
    Time Signature Handling: Offers utilities for working with time signatures, allowing composers to define complex rhythmic structures with ease.
    XML Conversion: Facilitates the conversion of music data into XML format, making it easier to share and publish compositions in standardized forms.
    Fraction Utilities: Provides functions for dealing with fractions, crucial for precise rhythm and duration calculations in music composition.

Getting Started (Early Access)

The project is in its early stages, and we encourage those interested in Haskell and music theory to explore the current modules and examples. Your feedback and contributions can significantly shape the development of HaskMus.
